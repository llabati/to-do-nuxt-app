# to-do-nuxt-app
a small app with Nuxt and Vuetify


It's the classical todo-list, with some improvements :
- a home page, plus four pages, one per CRUD action
- according to this app's concept, data are persisted on localStorage => always run it at localhost:3000
- you can drag and drop tasks, and the change in the list is saved
- many users can save their tasks on this app


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
